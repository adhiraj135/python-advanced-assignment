    "ans: The following are the new features added in the Python 3.8 version: \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. The walrus operator\n",
    "Assignment expressions have come to Python with the \"walrus\" operator :=. This will enable you to assign values to a variable as part of an expression. The major benefit of this is it saves you some lines of code when you want to use, say, the value of an expression in a subs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    eg: while line := f.readline():\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Positional-only arguments\n",
    "A special marker, /, can now be used when defining a method's arguments to specify that the functional only accepts positional arguments on the left of the marker. Keyword-only arguments have been available in Python with the * marker in functions, and addition of / marker for positional-only arguments improves the language's consistency and allows for a robust API design.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. f-strings now support \"=\"\n",
    "Python programmers often use \"printf-style\" debugging. f-strings make this a bit nicer:\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(f\"foo={foo} bar={bar}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "4. reversed() now works with dict\n",
    "Since Python 3.7, dictionaries preserve the order of insertion of keys. The reversed() built-in can now be used to access the dictionary in the reverse order of insertion — just like OrderedDict.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Simplified iterable unpacking for return and yield\n",
    "This unintentional behavior has existed since Python 3.2 which disallowed unpacking iterables without parentheses in return and yield statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "    eg: \n",
    "    def baz():\n",
    "      rest = (4, 5, 6)\n",
    "      return 1, 2, 3, \\*rest"

    "Deep copy is a process in which the copying process occurs recursively. It means first constructing a new collection object and then recursively populating it with copies of the child objects found in the original. In case of deep copy, a copy of object is copied in other object. It means that any changes made to a copy of object do not reflect in the original object. In python, this is implemented using “deepcopy()” function.\n",
